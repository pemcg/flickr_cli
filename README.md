# flickr_cli
Command-line tool to simplify admin of newly uploaded photos. It’s very specifically customised for my usage, but anyone is free to use and adapt to their own use. My use case is mainly film photography. I have several cameras and lenses, and like the photo to be added to albums for the camera and lens that was used to take the shot. I add the photo to a selection of film-related groups, as well as camera, lens and film specific groups where appropriate. Other groups are selected depending on whether the image is colour or black and white, the film format (35mm or 120), aspect ratio (6x45, 6x6 etc), camera type (eg TLR), and square photo-specific groups if the pixel aspect ratio is exactly square.

There are several command line arguments.

## ./flickr_cli.py --id 54895067952 --add

This does the main donkey work of adding a newly uploaded photo to relevant groups and albums, and adds tags.

The procedure to use is:

Upload a photo using the Flickr uploader. The photo should have exif camera and lens data set that match corresponding album names, for example “Nikon F3” and "Nikkor 35mm f/2 Ai”.

Tag the photo with the film vendor name and type, for example "Kodak"  "Portra 800” or "Kentmere" "Kentmere 200"

Copy the new photo’s id from the page url

Add the id to the flickr_cli command line.

Example output:
